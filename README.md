# Task 1
Complete the program from the class work (see files Account.java and MainAccounts.java).

You need to create your own InvalidEmail exception.

When you try to create an Account, you need to throw your own exception if there is no '@' character in the passed email address.

# Task 2* (optional)
Create a Rectangle class.

When creating the class, the class should get the side lengths. Save them in memory as fields (attributes) of the class "length" and "width".

When trying to compare two rectangles, they should be the same if the rectangles themselves are equal as geometric figures - if they can be combined by rotating and superimposing them on each other.
